// some key points
//  So it's important to remember that just because a DApp is on Ethereum does not
//  automatically mean it's decentralized â€” you have to actually read the full source
//  code to make sure it's free of special controls by the owner that you need to
//  potentially worry about. There's a careful balance as a developer between maintaining
//  control over a DApp such that you can fix potential bugs, and building an owner-less
//   platform that your users can trust to secure their data.
