@title and @author are straightforward.

@notice explains to a user what the contract / function does.
@dev is for explaining extra details to developers.

@param and @return are for describing what each parameter and return value of a function are for.

Note that you don't always have to use all of these tags for every function — all tags are optional.
But at the very least, leave a @dev note explaining what each function does.
